# MicroCloud-Connect
Implemented a microservices architecture project to foster modularity and scalability. Developed two
microservices orchestrated using Spring Cloud technologies, including Spring Cloud Config Server for centralized
configuration management, Eureka for service discovery, Feign client for declarative RESTful communication, and
an API Gateway for efficient routing. Employed Spring Cloud Load Balancer for distributing traffic across instances.
Utilized Spring Data JPA with an H2 database for seamless CRUD operations, ensuring data integrity and
persistence within the microservices ecosystem.
